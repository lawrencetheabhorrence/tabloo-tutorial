# Disclaimer
This app works with only the Attendee files that are uncleaned if you already cleaned the attendee file you can run the command `tabloo_cli NAME_OF_REPORT`.

# Instructions
Just type in `python tabloo_script.py NAME_OF_UNCLEANED_REPORT`. Then tabloo will launch a view of your csv but with options to sort by column or to filter data. Refer to https://github.com/bluenote10/tabloo for instructions for filtering data.
